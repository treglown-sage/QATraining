# write an application that checks the strength of a password.
# Requirements:
# 
# Write a class that has a method that checks the password strength.
# Use factors like length, upper/lower case and if it has a number and special character.
# ratings should be very weak - weak - moderate - strong - very strong 
# Check against a list of common passwords 10-20 common password = very weak
# User input that loops until the user quits
# User input that loops until the user quits
# A dictionary that returns a history of passwords/strengths whilst in the loop.
# Code must be pushed to a repo and 1 person per group must share with me. 
# 12.15 deadline
